# AI Code Quality Assistant

A real-time AI-powered code analysis tool built on Cloudflare Workers and Next.js, designed to help developers identify security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and code quality improvements through an interactive chat interface.

## Cloudflare AI Assignment Compliance

This project fully implements the required components for Cloudflare's AI application assignment:

- **LLM Integration**: Utilizes Llama 3.3 via Workers AI as the primary model, with optional OpenAI GPT-4 fallback for enhanced analysis.
- **Workflow/Coordination**: Employs Cloudflare Workflows and Durable Objects to manage parallel analysis processes (security, performance, quality) with error handling and retry logic.
- **User Input via Chat**: Features a responsive chat interface built with Next.js and WebSockets for real-time user interaction.
- **Memory/State**: Leverages Durable Objects for persistent session management, analysis history, and automatic cleanup.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Performs parallel security, performance, and quality assessments on submitted code.
- **Real-time Chat**: Interactive interface with streaming responses and persistent conversation history.
- **Serverless Architecture**: Built entirely on Cloudflare's platform for scalability and cost efficiency.
- **Multi-Model Support**: Seamlessly integrates Workers AI and external LLMs with AI Gateway routing.

## Architecture

The application consists of a Next.js frontend for the user interface and a Cloudflare Workers backend for AI processing:

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with App Router, Tailwind CSS, and Radix UI components for a modern, responsive chat experience.
- **Backend**: Cloudflare Workers with TypeScript, handling AI model interactions and state via Durable Objects.
- **AI Agents**: Custom agents (`CodeQualityAgent` and `SimpleCodeAgent`) that process code analysis requests.
- **State Management**: Durable Objects provide persistent storage for sessions and analysis results.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Cloudflare account with Workers AI enabled
- OpenAI API key (optional)

### Installation and Running
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Configure environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
   # Edit .dev.vars with your API keys
   ```

3. Run the application:
   - Both servers: `npm run dev:full`
   - Separately: `npm run dev:worker` (backend) and `npm run dev` (frontend)

Ports: Frontend at http://localhost:3000, Backend at http://localhost:8787

### Troubleshooting
- Ensure both servers are running for API calls to work.
- Check CORS settings in `src/index.ts` if encountering 404 errors.
- Verify Durable Objects are properly configured in `wrangler.jsonc`.

## Deployment

Deploy to Cloudflare:
```bash
npm run deploy
```
