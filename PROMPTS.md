# AI Prompts Used in Development

This document lists the AI prompts and interactions used during the development of the AI Code Quality Assistant project. AI-assisted coding was used for various practical tasks including minor refactoring, bug fixes, documentation, and code improvements.

## Bug Fix Assistance

**Prompt:** "I'm getting a 'Cannot read property 'map' of undefined' error in my React component when rendering analysis results. Help me debug this issue."

**Response Summary:** Identified that the analysis results might be undefined initially, suggested adding optional chaining and null checks, and recommended using conditional rendering to prevent the error.

## Documentation Writing

**Prompt:** "Write a clear function documentation comment for this TypeScript method that handles code quality analysis. Include parameter descriptions and return value explanation."

**Response Summary:** Generated a comprehensive JSDoc comment with detailed parameter descriptions, return type information, and usage examples for the analysis method.

## Code Review and Suggestions

**Prompt:** "Review this React component for potential performance optimizations. It's a chat message component that renders dynamically."

**Response Summary:** Recommended using React.memo for preventing unnecessary re-renders, suggested optimizing the message rendering logic, and proposed adding proper key props for list items.

Note: While I didn't maintain a detailed record of every AI interaction, the examples above represent the types of assistance I received throughout development. I primarily used AI for code refactoring, debugging TypeScript issues, implementing UI components, and writing documentation.
